Yeah in my neighbourhood,
We're all good, like we should,
It's understood that in my neighbourhood,
It's okay, to be great,
Come let it blow your mind away

Throw out your uniform,
Don't need it anymore,
Don't be nobody 'cause somebody is all you can be,
So drop the act you play,
This ain't a masquerade,
'Cause where we going we'll just be you and me.

Oh, yeah, yeah

Don't care 'bout yesterday,
It's over anyway,
How come tomorrow's the place where everyone should be,
Forget the heat you took,
You'll get the right bits hooked,
'Cause where we going the streets will set you free

Yeah in my neighbourhood,
We're all good, like we should,
It's understood that in my neighbourhood,
It's okay, to be great,
Come let it blow your mind away

There ain't no other place,
That makes me feel this way,
It's always happening so no one's ever outside of town,
Turn off the city lights,
It won't get dark tonight,
'Cause everybody who's here came out to shine

Yeah in my neighbourhood,
We're all good, like we should,
It's understood that in my neighbourhood,
It's okay, to be great,
Come let it blow your mind away

I can see that you're feeling,
You believing 'cause it's in your face,
And you know that you need it,
It's nothing but a state agreed (nothing but a state agreed)

Yeh in my neighbourhood,
We're all good (were all good), like we should (like we should),
It's understood that in my neighbourhood (it's understood),
It's okay (its okay), to be great (to be great),
Come let it blow your mind away (let it blow),

Oh, Yeah hey

Yeah in my neighbourhood
