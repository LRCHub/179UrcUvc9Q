When I was a kid
I used to drive downtown with a friend
Counting all the trees
Making sure none disappeared
Listing number plates
We were greeting foreign cars

We were hanging out
In the neighbourhood
Not knowing this might
End on tonight

When I was a boy
I used to hang out in the park
Always ending up
Loving the same girl from the park

When I'm looking back
That was much more common ground
Growing up so fast
Complicated what we had

We were hanging out
In the neighbourhood
Not knowing this might
End on tonight

We were hanging out
In the neighbourhood
Not knowing this might
End on tonight
